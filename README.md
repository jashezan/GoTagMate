GoTagMate is a powerful and user-friendly VSCode extension designed to **simplify working with Go struct tags**. It provides **intelligent suggestions, autocompletion, and detailed documentation** for popular Go libraries like `json`, `gorm`, `validate`, and many more. **Press `Ctrl + Space` if suggestions don't appear automatically.**

> **Why GoTagMate?** Writing Go struct tags manually can be tedious and error-prone. Missing a comma, mistyping a field, or forgetting a tag option can break your code. GoTagMate solves this problem by automatically suggesting and completing struct tags, reducing errors and boosting productivity.
